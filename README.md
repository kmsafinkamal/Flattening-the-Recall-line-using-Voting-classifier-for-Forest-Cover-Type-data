This paper focuses on the application of a Voting 
Classifier to address the challenge of flattening the recall line in 
the classification of Forest Cover Type data. Forest cover is 
crucial for biodiversity preservation and climate regulation, and 
accurate classification of forest cover types is essential for 
effective forest management. The paper utilizes a dataset 
containing attributes related to forest cover, and machine 
learning models such as Random Forests, K-Nearest Neighbors 
(KNN), Extra Trees, and XGBoost are employed. However, the 
performance of individual models may vary in terms of recall. 
To overcome this, a Voting Classifier is introduced, which 
combines the predictions from multiple models using a majority 
or weighted vote. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness 
of the Voting Classifier in flattening the recall line and 
enhancing the accuracy of forest cover type classification.
